 * Single source of truth for "who can see/do what." An admin's roles
 * and features are the union of every package they're assigned
 * (`admin_package` → `package_role`/`package_feature`) — see
 * App\Models\Admin, Package, Role, Feature, AdminPackage. Developer
 * accounts never go through here at all: they're a separate table/
 * guard (App\Models\Developer) and bypass this entirely.
 *
 * Every controller and the `permission` route middleware should go
 * through `can()` / `canAccessHotel()` / `canAccessLocation()` rather
 * than hand-rolling a check — one place to get this right.
 *
 * Scoping is entirely schema-driven, not name-matched: `Role::is_global`
 * and `Role::scope` (`none`|`location`|`hotel`) decide *what kind* of
 * scoping a role implies, and `location_ids`/`hotel_ids` on the
 * `admin_package` pivot (App\Models\AdminPackage) — not on the admin
 * itself — decide the actual scope for *that* package assignment. An
 * admin holding two location-scoped packages can be scoped to two
 * different sets of locations; a developer creating a brand-new
 * location- or hotel-scoped role via Developer\RoleController gets
 * real, working scope checks immediately.
