/**
 * Spec section 8 "Locations" — perm `locations`
 * (`permission:locations` on every route in routes/admin.php).
 *
 * Scope (spec section 5), entirely schema-driven via
 * App\Models\Role::scope (see AccessService — no role names
 * hard-coded here): a location-scoped role only sees locations in its
 * `locationIds`; a hotel-scoped role only sees a location if one of
 * its hotels is in it. "Resource exists but out of scope → 404
 * preferred" — show()/update()/destroy() 404 rather than 403 for a
 * location an admin can't reach, so as not to leak that it exists.
 *
 * store() authorization (2026-09-15 policy): a developer can always
 * create (bypasses this controller's `permission:` gate entirely). An
 * admin can create iff their effective packages grant the `locations`
 * feature — already enforced by the route's `permission:locations`
 * middleware before this method runs, so store() adds no further
 * scope/global check on top of it. This replaces an earlier
 * global-seats-only restriction on create — the user judged that too
 * restrictive once an admin's package already grants the feature.
 *
 * destroy() is still restricted to global seats — tearing down a whole
 * destination wasn't part of this change; only create moved to
 * feature-only.
 *
 * update() field-level gating (2026-09-15, reworked 2026-09-16): the
 * seeded `permissions` catalog (App\Models\Permission) lists 5 entries
 * under the `locations` feature — `locations_list`, `locations_managers`,
 * `locations_hotels`, `locations_publish`, `locations_seo` — matching
 * the developer package-builder UI (toggle the parent `locations`
 * feature, then fine-tune which of its permissions a package actually
 * grants). Originally (Round 8) these were child *features* strung
 * together via `features.parent_key`; the doc maker's "package ->
 * permissions, feature -> permissions" sample replaced that with a
 * real `permissions` table + `package_permission` — see
 * App\Services\AccessService::hasPermission()/effectivePermissionKeys().
 * Behavior for admins is unchanged, only the storage moved. Three of
 * the 5 gate specific fields on update(), on top of the parent
 * `locations` feature gate (still required via route middleware just
 * to reach this controller at all):
 *   - name/slug/description/heroImage/gallery/highlights →
 *     `locations_list` ("view and edit destination content")
 *   - status → `locations_publish` ("publish / archive")
 *   - seoTitle/seoDescription → `locations_seo` ("SEO fields")
 * `locations_hotels` (Hotel's own `locationId` linking — a structural
 * FK relationship, not an action on Location itself) and
 * `locations_managers` (assigning a manager to a destination) are
 * intentionally **not** wired to anything here: the former has no
 * corresponding Location-side action to gate, and the latter stays a
 * developer-only capability (`routes/developer.php`) — the user
 * explicitly chose not to open a new "admin assigns other admins"
 * capability for now (Round 8). Both remain real, developer-CRUD-able,
 * package-assignable permission keys (so they show and toggle
 * correctly in the package builder); they just don't unlock anything
 * yet. index/show/destroy are unaffected by any of this — only
 * update()'s field set is gated per-field, so an admin missing one
 * permission can still touch every other field in the same request.
 *
 * store() quantity cap (2026-09-16): on top of the feature gate above,
 * an admin's packages can also cap *how many* locations they're
 * allowed to create in total — App\Services\AccessService::effectiveLimit()
 * against the `locations` resource key (App\Models\PackageLimit). Not
 * a scope restriction (an admin can still create outside their own
 * scope, per the 2026-09-15 policy above) — this is purely "how many,"
 * counted from `locations.created_by_admin_id`, which this method sets
 * on every location it creates. Round 12 (2026-09-22) capped every
 * seeded package by default — see `database/seeders/PackageSeeder.php`'s
 * docblock: the sole `Admin` package is capped at 3, and all 3
 * `Manager · <City>` packages are capped at 0 (can't add locations at
 * all — "no adding properties"). `effectiveLimit()` returns `null` for
 * "no cap," so a developer building a brand-new, genuinely uncapped
 * package can still get one by simply omitting a `locations` limit row
 * — the common no-cap case costs one cheap collection scan and no
 * query.
