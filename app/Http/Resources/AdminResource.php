 * camelCase shape for an admin-panel account. Deliberately minimal:
 * "each user just has the packages assigned by developer" — there's no
 * top-level `roles`/`featureKeys` (each package entry below already
 * carries its own, same as `PackageResource`) and no top-level
 * `locationIds`/`hotelIds` (each package *assignment* carries its own
 * scope on the `admin_package` pivot — see App\Models\AdminPackage —
 * since the same package can be scoped differently for different
 * admins, or an admin can hold several differently-scoped packages at
 * once). See App\Services\AccessService for how these are actually
 * used to compute access.
