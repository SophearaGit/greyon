/**
 * An admin-panel account — everyone who isn't a `Developer` (its own
 * table/guard) or a `users` guest/manager. What an admin can actually
 * do is entirely determined by the `packages` they're assigned
 * (`admin_package`): each package grants a set of `roles` and
 * `features`, unioned across every package the admin holds, and each
 * *assignment* carries its own `location_ids`/`hotel_ids` scope (see
 * App\Models\AdminPackage) — see App\Services\AccessService. There's
 * no `role` column here on purpose, and no `location_ids`/`hotel_ids`
 * here either as of the schema-driven-scoping pass: both were tried as
 * flat columns on this table and backed out (see the migration
 * history) once it turned out scope belongs to a package assignment,
 * not the admin as a whole — an admin's *only* real attribute beyond
 * name/email/password/status is "which packages, each with its own
 * scope."
 *
 * Backed by its own `admins` table — never the `users` table. Admin
 * accounts are not self-registerable; they're created by a developer
 * via `App\Http\Controllers\Developer\AdminController` (or seeder/
 * tinker).
